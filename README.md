# NormalVSschizophrenia_Classification
Classification between normal people and schizophrenia patients using EEG signals and ML/DL algorithms

## Overview
```
Some Machine and Deep Learning algorithms are implemented to classify people as patients or healthy.
The best accuracy is of LSTM and SeparableConv2D.
```

## Requirements
- Python3
- Tensorflow
- Keras

## Usage
- Download [Dataset](http://brain.bio.msu.ru/eeg_schizophrenia.htm) from Lab of Neuro Interfaces
- Run any file using python3 filename.py
- Pickle objects are made so there is no need of extracting features.
